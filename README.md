# C Repository

This repo demonstrates my **C_basics learning journey**, organized by chapter. Each chapter has programs, exercises and supporting comments.

## **About structure**

The repo is organized as follows:

- **00 -**  Introduction to C programming
- **01 -**  Variables, Constants
- **02 -**  Instructions, Operators
- **03 -**  If, Else, Switch
- **04 -**  for, while, do-while loops
- **05 -**  Functions, Recursion
- **06 -**  Pointers and memory management
- **07 -**  1D and 2D arrays
- **08 -**  String handling in C
- **09 -**  Structs and user-defined types
- **10 -**  File input/output handling

## What I've learnt:
- C foundational concepts: variables, loops, conditionals, functions, pointers(p2p was a bit tricky), arrays, strings, structs, and file I/O.
- Having this much exposure with C, I can confidently write modular programs(w/out ai), debug errors(by myself) and had a bit upgrade in problem-solving(though initially it was irritating to make sure f in printf is present or missing :|
